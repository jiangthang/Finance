# Finance

Educational Projects I built using knowledge from my financial Math courses

1. Portfolio Optimization by maximizing the Sharpe Ratio

Portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best portfolio,
out of the set of portfolios/stocks being considered, according to some objective. The objective
typically maximizes factors such as expected return, and minimizes costs like financial risk.


2. Stock Price Prediction Using Python & Machine Learning (LSTM). 

I created an artificial neural network using Long Short Term Memory to predict the future price of stock.
